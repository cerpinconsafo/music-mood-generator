			- About this project -
		</h3>
		<section class="row">
			<p>The 'Mood Music Generator' is a fun and simple web app idea presented as an audio/visual experiment. Each button represents 'the mood', which contains a unique audio and visual experience. At first, I only thought about playing one video at a time. Eventually, I curated a nice batch of videos, and gave each 'mood' a larger selection to choose from. 
			</p>
			<p>Then I thought about how I sometimes I enjoy a sort of visual ambience when I browse audio on youtube. It is a video based platform after all! Those visual elements (think of a moving fireplace for the holidays, or a cafe with weather effects through the windows) are a great additional to the audio. Some of my videos were just static images playing the music, which was nice, but I wanted to have move visuals to look at. So in my search for good music, they also needed to have a unique visual element. </p>
			<p>Still, I wanted to add more interaction with the idea of audio and visual moods. What if we just gathered an entire seperate group of interesting videos, and allowed the ability to switch between different videos to display while listening? Maybe you want to the retro videogames video, or what if you prefer just a relaxing weather background video? Anime highlights? A nature livestream? </p>
			<p>This is the current iteration of the MMGen, and what I am working on. This is a constant work in progres.</p>
			<p>All in all, I hope you can find some interesting mood music and enjoy from the variety of visual options there are to accompany.</p>
